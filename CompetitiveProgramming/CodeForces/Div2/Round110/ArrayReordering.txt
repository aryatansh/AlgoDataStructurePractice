You are given an array 𝑎 consisting of 𝑛 integers.

Let's call a pair of indices 𝑖, 𝑗 good if 1≤𝑖<𝑗≤𝑛 and gcd(𝑎𝑖,2𝑎𝑗)>1 (where gcd(𝑥,𝑦) is the greatest common divisor of 𝑥 and 𝑦).

Find the maximum number of good index pairs if you can reorder the array 𝑎 in an arbitrary way.

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of the test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤2000) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤105).

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 2000.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of good index pairs if you can reorder the array 𝑎 in an arbitrary way.

Note
In the first example, the array elements can be rearranged as follows: [6,3,5,3].

In the third example, the array elements can be rearranged as follows: [4,4,2,1,1]
